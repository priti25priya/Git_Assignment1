Question 4
Step 1: Step 1: Create a feature branch.
Step 2: Switch to the new branch.
		open the file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
		open the same file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
		open the same file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
Step 3: Identify the commit or commits that you want to "cherry-pick"(Note the hash of the commit or commits that you want to "cherry-pick")
Step 4: Use the "git checkout" command to switch to the branch where you want to apply the changes.
Step 5: Use the "git cherry-pick" command followed by the commit hash(es) that you want to apply.

Question 5
Step 1: Step 1: Create a feature branch.
Step 2: Switch to the new branch.
		open the file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
		open the same file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
		open the same file and make some changes to it.
		Add and commit the changes to the new branch.
Step 3: Use the "git log" command to view the commit history and identify the commit to which you want to reset.
Step 4: Use the "git reset" command followed by the desired reset type and the commit hash
Step 5: Verify that the reset was successful by using the "git log" command again. 
Step 6: Use the "git log" command to view the commit history and identify the commit that you want to reverse.
Step 7: Use the "git revert" command followed by the commit hash or reference to which you want to revert. (Hint: git revert <commit hash>)
Step 8: Verify that the revert was successful by using the "git log" command again.
Note: Identify the difference between git log after git reset and git r evert.
